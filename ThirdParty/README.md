# Third-Party-programs

Four external tools are needed by WirelessDisplay:

- A VNC-server and a VNC-client,
- ffmpeg (and ffplay),
- A tool to mangage screen-resolutions of the local computer.
- A tool to prevent the display from blanking (and the computer from enter an
  energy-saving mode / sleep-mode).

These tools are started by the scripts in the directory 
[Scripts/<Operating-System>]. Have a look at the [README.md] in the directory
[Scripts] and the [README.md] in its sub-directories for furhter information.

Note: If you plan to use either only VNC or only ffmpeg, it is not necessary to
install the other tool.

For further installation instructions, see the [README.md] in the subfolder for 
the used operating-system.
