# Third-party-programs for Windows

All Third-party-programs are open-source-programs. I provide a copy 
programs here:

- [https://github.com/lzukw/Third-party-tools](https://github.com/lzukw/Third-party-tools)

The other needed programs can be found here:

- [https://github.com/lzukw/ScreenRes](https://github.com/lzukw/ScreenRes)
- [https://github.com/lzukw/PreventTurnOffDisplay](https://github.com/lzukw/PreventTurnOffDisplay)

See [README.md] in the subfolders for instructions on how to "install" (i.e.
download and extract) the programs.

Afterwards double-check the correct paths to the executable files: See
[WirelessDisplay/Scripts/README.md] for these paths.
