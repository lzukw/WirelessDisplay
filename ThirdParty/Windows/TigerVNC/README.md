# TigerVNC

NOTE: For now, tigervnc is not used (only VNCopen) is used. So this
directory can reamin empty.

If you wish to try tigerVNC, read on.

NOTE: Only vncviewer.exe from TigerVNC has worked for now. The server hasn't 
worked until now. Maybe a real installation of TigerVNC is required on Windows 
to use TigerVNC on a presentation computer as streaming-source (with 
winvnc4.exe from TigerVNC)

The four compiled files must be here:

- vncconfig.exe
- vncviewer.exe
- winvnc4.exe
- wm_hooks.dll
